# Dummy blood sugar monitoring
Example project to record and visualise twice-daily blood glucose monitoring results 

## Motivation
To enabling graphing of blood sugar readings, both raw and summarised.  
To demonstrate ability to summarise and visualise data using R, and basic familiarity with GitHub.

## Completed functionality

Raw data converted to datasets:

* All measurements with daily average ("daily" data)
* Rolling average of the last 7 days or last 10 measurements ("rolling" data)

Graph function allows user to specify graph type (daily or rolling) and time period (all available data, or most recent X days).

## In the pipeline

* Calculate and graph cumulative averages and/or line of best fit
* Summarise data at level of week and month
* Shiny app
